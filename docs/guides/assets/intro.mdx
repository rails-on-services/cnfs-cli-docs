## Overview

- Things: dependencies images providers resources services users (blueprints registries assets)
- Operators: provisioners repositories runtimes (builders configurators)

- Builders manage images; This could be compose/skaffold to make images or packer to create images
- Configurators manage playbooks; This could be Ansible to run playbooks on local or remote machines
- Provisioners create/destroy resources, e.g. Terraform, Pulumi, aws-cdk, etc
- Runtimes manage content, i.e. services, on resources, e.g. Compose, Skaffold, Bucket

Repositories create/destroy service implementations in repositories

Components: component project
Support: context context_component node runtime/services (provisioner/resources repository/services ?)

## Operators


class Runtime

- This is the base class for classes that manage services. It is an STI class that provides the underlying db columns and any common methods
- defines the commands method that is a contract for the subclasses to implement

All assets managed by operators have state and callbacks. This is the Target concern
Eg if an RDS db is about to be destroyed by terraform then it can execute a before_destroy and do something eg pg_dump the data
So this is a standard callback invocation from Operators

1. State is managed in the asset's cache_file so those files should be merged in when building the context
2. To invoke a command on an Operator call Operator#execute function. This will invoke callbacks on the operator and its targets

## Operators and Targets


1. Operators need to update state on targets and/or invoke their callbacks, eg before Provisioner destroys a resource have to execute callback and maybe even can_destroy?

- Operator classes define commands array
- Operator Concern defines target_callbacks array
- Target class method defines its operator
- Target Concern defines callbacks based on Target.operator.target_callbacks

Image can implement before_push and after_pull
Resource has before_destroy and after_create
Service can implement after_start and before_terminate

If an EC2 resource is running docker containers and it is about to be destroyed it calls the resource before_destroy which can invoke before_terminate on all services running on itself

Could integrate with slack to notify on events

### Resources

- runtime_type also so it gets the right type. This is a validation on the class itself rather than in configuration
- same thing with provider. Aws resources must have an Aws provider
- EC2 resources should be auto populated with the provider so I can invoke list methods without needing to configure the provider
- Resource has a validator that if provider is set that it must be of a specific type, eg AWS resource types must have an AWS type provider
- log a warning if the validation failed

### Repositories

```shell
The CLI will automatically search each subdirectory of <repository_root>
Project components that reference repository components need to supply the entire component path relative from <project_root>/src
component_path:  <repository_root>/<component_name>

repository_root/<component_name>/component.yml
repository_root/<component_name>/app
repository_root/<component_name>/component
repository_root/<component_name>/config/initializers
repository_root/src

OR
If component directories are in a different location then <repository_root> create a file <repository_root>/repository.yml with the following contents:
components_path: <relative_path_to_components>

repository_root/components/<component_name>/component.yml
repository_root/components/<component_name>/app
repository_root/cnfs/components/<component_name>/component
repository_root/cnfs/components/<component_name>/config/initializers
repository_root/cnfs/components/<component_name>/src
```

### Providers and Provisioners


- There are multiple provider types, e.g. aws, google, proxmox, rest, etc
- Each provider is an STI type so that it can:
  - define configuration values for that specific provider, e.g. aws region and access_key_id
  - define values that need to be encrypted, e.g. aws secret_access_key and proxmox pm_password
  - validate the configuration
  - The Provider STI classes are from gems or repository components but as STI classes they cannot add fields to the base class
- Provider values for Provisioners:
  - base Provider is Provisioner agnostic
  - different provisioners may require different values in the config, e.g. TF provider for Proxmox needs the URL to d/l the provider and the attributes, e.g. pm_user, pm_password could be different for Pulumi. The AWS keys are probably standard between provisioners, but this is not guaranteed, it's only by convention
  - So each Provider must implement as_<provisioner_type> which returns a hash of the relevant values required by the Provisioner which means that providers have to support specific provisioners and it's possible that a provider type, e.g. AWS, only supports Terraform and CloudFormation but not Pulumi
  - Provisioners and their templates do not have specific knowledge of any provider. They just call provider#as_<provisioner_type>
  - So Provisioners define what data is needed from each Provider type and the Provider must implement the method to return the required data
- Custom Provider, e.g. Proxmox, in a Repository Component
  - For each Provisioner type, e.g. Terraform, to be supported, implement the as_<provider_type> method
